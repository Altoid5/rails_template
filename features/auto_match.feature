Feature: Automatic Matching System
  As a UTRGV user
  I want the system to automatically match lost and found items
  So that I donâ€™t have to manually search for my lost belongings

  Scenario: System suggests a match for a lost item
    Given a new found item is reported
    And its details match a lost item
    When the system runs an auto-match check
    Then the user who lost the item should receive a notification

  Scenario: System flags potential duplicate reports
    Given a user tries to submit a lost item report
    And a similar report already exists
    When they submit the form
    Then they should receive a warning about the duplicate
